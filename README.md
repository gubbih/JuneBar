# Junebar Cocktail App

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a personal tool to streamline the process of learning and referencing cocktail recipes at my workplace. Instead of navigating through seven pages of recipes—or waiting for a colleague to finish using a shared reference sheet—I can easily look up any recipe directly on my phone.

### Important Note

This app is for personal use only and is not affiliated with Junebar. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in app development and my ability to create practical solutions to real-world problems.
